    "## Instructions:\n",
    "Use this Thanksgiving dataset to explore patterns in the family dining habits.\n",

    "You will being using **only the describe function** to answer your questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Looking at the minimum and maximum values of Age, what do they suggest about who attended this Thanksgiving dinner? <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Looking at the mean and standard deviation of Dinner_Duration, what do they show about how consistent the mealtime was across family members? <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If someone stayed for 4.8 hours, would you consider them an outlier? _Use the mean and standard deviation to support your answer (Hint: $mean + 2*std$ OR $IQR=Q3−Q1$ and $Upper Bound=Q3+1.5×IQR$)._ <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Compare the mean and median of Dinner_Servings. What could a large difference between them indicate about family member behavior? _(Hint: 50% is half way in the data set)_ <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Looking at the max value of Dessert_Servings, what type of guest do you imagine that might be and what could this tell us about dessert consumption overall?  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Suppose the standard deviation of Dinner_Serving is small. What does that suggest about how much everyone ate?  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Which statistic (min, max, mean, std) best helps you find the “light eaters”? Explain how you would identify them and if the minimum makes sense.<br>\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The range (max − min) of Dinner_Duration is quite large. What could that imply about how the dinner was organized?  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "9. You suspect that older guests tend to eat fewer desserts. Could you use only the `describe` function to explore whether that idea might be true before doing a full analysis or would we have to include something else?  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What does the mean tell you about how common it was for people to watch the Macy’s Day Parade?  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "11. what does the standard deviation suggest about the variation in watching behavior? Was parade-watching behavior fairly consistent across people, or was there a lot of difference between individuals?  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "12. In one sentence, summarize what kind of Thanksgiving this dataset represents. Focus on what the numbers imply rather than just stating the numbers.  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Suggest some visuals that would be ideal for exploring this data and state their purpose. <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n"
